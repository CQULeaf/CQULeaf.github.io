It is the early morning of May 19, 2024, and the first personal blog will be written at this time, I think I will remember this moment forever.

Before, I always thought that blogging was a very laborious and useless thing, so although I built [this personal website](https://yexuhang.com) very early, I never started my first article.

But when I started to understand the **BDD** method which means **Blog-Driven Development**, I began to find blogging could be a very meaningful and interesting way for me to exposure to new things, learn new knowledge, and summarize new ideas.

So from now and here on start a fantastic BDD journey by getting this 1st blog done.
The article that inspires me is [this article](https://www.saiyangrowthletter.com/p/blog-driven-development-bdd-to-become?ref=dailydev), telling us why, what, when, and how to write blogs.
